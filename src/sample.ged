He married Eleanor Holland in 1823, in Halifax.  Thomas Goff and his brother-in-law Anthony Henry Hol1 CONC land, the founder and first editor of one of Atlantic Canada’s first newspapers, the Acadian Recorder, had a number o1 CONC f business ventures together. The biography of Anthony Holland has been written in the “Dictionary of Canadian Biograph1 CONC y” by Miss Gertrude Tratt. Thomas was involved with Anthony in the establishment of the first paper mill in the provinc1 CONC e, built at the head of the Bedford Basin in 1819. The paper was made from linen and was used in the printing of the Ac1 CONC adian Recorder and the various phamplets which issued from his press. The heavy paper manufactured at this mill was sai1 CONC d to be of a tolerably good description (Halifax: Warden of the North). 1 CONT1 CONT It is likely that Anthony Holland and John and Thomas Goff became acquainted around 1819, when Holland began his operat1 CONC ion on the northwest of the Bedford Basin. (It is possible they were acquainted previous, but we have no evidence to co1 CONC nnect John to Halifax city or to the Little Dutch Church or the German population with whom Holland had his roots.) Tho1 CONC mas was 23 years old in 1819. Two of the papermakers in the mill in 1821, Samuel Courtney and John Campbell, both marri1 CONC ed sisters of Anthony’s in 1821 (Note: neither are in the 1827 Nova Scotia census). In 1823, Thomas married Anthony’s y1 CONC oungest sister Eleanor (marriage bond at NSARM dated 2 May 1823 between Thomas Goff, bachelor, residence “on the new Da1 CONC rtmouth Road to Sackville”, occupation farmer, and Eleanor Holland, spinster) and in 1826, Anthony’s brother Nicholas m1 CONC arried Thomas’ sister Mary. In 1823, Thomas’ address was listed as “on the new Dartmouth Road to Sackville”, i.e., on t1 CONC he east side of the Basin, likely John’s property. John Goff deeded property to Thomas in 1819. By 1827, and likely soo1 CONC n after their marriage, it appears that Thomas and Eleanor were living “on the Hammonds Plains Road”, very near to th1 CONC e Nine Mile House and Anthony’s home, perhaps a part of his landholdings. The 31 December 1827 census of Hammond's Plai1 CONC ns lists Thomas Goff, with 3 males, 2 females, and 1 servant residing in the house; religion listed as Anglican. In th1 CONC e 1827 census, Thomas’ occupation is named as “Agriculture”; the household beside Thomas was that of John Grigrey, occu1 CONC pation papermaker. Between 1823 and 1830, Thomas and Eleanor had 5 children. Thomas has been described in various histo1 CONC ries (including Thomas Randall’s Halifax: Warden of the North) as being “involved with” Anthony in the operations of th1 CONC e paper mill. John Goff and Thomas Goff are both in the 1827 census of Hammonds Plains district, but separated by sever1 CONC al families. On 11 May 1830, Thomas and Anthony Holland jointly received a water lot on the Bedford Basin, Thomas’ occu1 CONC pation listed as “husbandsman”.  1 CONT1 CONT Anthony died in a driving accident (fall from a horse) on Oct 10 1830 and on Nov 8, 1830, Eliza (Mrs. Anthony) Holland1 CONC , Phillip John Holland and James William Merkel (Eliza’s brother), executors of the estate of Anthony, leased to Thoma1 CONC s Goff for three years all of the land holdings of Anthony, 1000 acres, including the Nine Mile House. We have a copy o1 CONC f that lease, found in the home of Mr. Alex Goff. The Nine Mile House was an Inn of Bedford fame, run by Holland from 11 CONC 823 to his death, during which time it was also known as Holland’s Inn. On Nov 22, 1830, Thomas is advertising “To be l1 CONC et, that pleasantly situated cottage with garden etc. attached thereto, recently occupied by the late Mr. A H Holland o1 CONC n the Windsor Road, within eight miles of Halifax. It will be let for one or more years, as may be agreed upon. Inquire1 CONC s on the premises of Thomas Goff.” 1 CONT1 CONT Acadian Recorder, Nov. 20, 1832 “Nine Mile House. The Subscriber having again rented the above house, with all the grou1 CONC nds, etc. attached thereto, is now fitting it up in a more convenient style, as a Public Inn, begs leave to inform hi1 CONC s friends both in Town and Country, that he will not fail to use his best endeavours to give general satisfaction; hi1 CONC s larder will be well supplied, his liquors of the best quality, and his stables (which are superior well attended to1 CONC . THOMAS GOFF.”1 CONT1 CONT John McGregor leased the Acadian Paper Mill and about 13 acres of surrounding land from Anthony Holland in 1829. McGreo1 CONC gor ran an ad in the 15 Sept 1832 Acadian Recorder: “Acadian Paper Mills For Sale. 8 ½ miles from Halifax on Hammonds P1 CONC lains Road. Only one of a kind in the Province. Dams permanently fixed to give supply of water. Machinery of the best m1 CONC ake, in good repair. New machine recently from United Sates makes double quantity of paper. Rope cutting machine from B1 CONC oston, boxes for new way of bleaching. Mill house is strong stone building, 35x45x22 high, and drying loft of wood. 11 CONC 0 acres belong to mill.

One was lately occupied by saw mill. Mill ne1 CONC ver freezes. Apply P. J. Holland, or to the proprietor on premises.”  (Tolson). James W. Merkel and P.J. Holland forecl1 CONC osed on Mr. McGregor's mortgage in 1835, and then leased the mill in 1837 to the Piers' family.1 CONT1 CONT From 1830 to 1840, it appears that Thomas operated the Nine Mile House and various properties associated with it, and a1 CONC t some point acquired at least some of it from the estate of Anthony Holland. He was variously listed as “tavern keeper1 CONC ” or “innkeeper” in historical records from this time. He also was a grist mill operator at Piers Mill (Tolson). He wa1 CONC s said to have been Proprietor of Eight Mile House (which, I think, was the same Inn), 1832-1839. He was listed as a tr1 CONC ustee of Birch Cove School District #8 , 12 June 1835. On the school roster were William Goff 12, John Goff 10, Margare1 CONC t Goff 8 and Thomas Goff 7, children of Thomas Goff. Thomas appears to have financially supported several other schoo1 CONC l children as well. Thomas and Eleanor had 3 more children between 1830 and 1840.1 CONT1 CONT “Piers Cove. On March 26, 1836, William Bevil Thomas Piers bought two pieces of land at Millview from Henry Mixner fo1 CONC r 500 pounds. Mixner’s tannery (from 1813) was on one piece. Piers built a grist mill on the other, using the same wate1 CONC r power as did the Acadian Paper Mill. The mill was built was built was a large overshoot waterwheel on the north sid1 CONC e of the building. The tannery was in the yard of a small house near the mill. Mr. Piers’ purchase included that hous1 CONC e plus a large house to the north. It was a pretty house, a spreading English country home type, with a fine row of nat1 CONC ive elms. It was occupied from 1836 by Piers. A wharf, store house and grain elevator were built beside the mill and Th1 CONC omas Goff was the miller at the Grist Mill. He was proprietor of Eight Mile House from 1832-39 and that Inn was very ne1 CONC ar the mill. Good-sized vessels brought corn to the wharf, and for 72 years the cove was known as Piers’ Cove, or Piers1 CONC ’ Mill Cove. In 1837, Piers obtained a 5-year lease on the Acadian Paper Mill, the house, etc. at the foot of paper Mil1 CONC l Lake on the Hammonds Plains Road. James W. Merkel (Anthony Holland’s wife’s brother) was administrator of the Hollan1 CONC d estate and granted the lease. Piers also manufactured line and twine at Piers Cove.” (Tolson) (Note: she refers to Th1 CONC omas as proprietor of Eight Mile House, likely referring to what they called the Nine Mile House)1 CONT1 CONT The paper mill must have stayed in the Holland family for many years. From www.hughespaper.com, “A document, dated 10 O1 CONC ctober 1873 shows that Daniel Hughes and his sons took over the lease of this mill from Jeremiah O'Connor. This lease1 CONC , from William Holland (Anthony’s son, 1826-1875) was due to expire on 1 May 1875 and covered "All that piece or parce1 CONC l of land on the old Hammond's Plains Road in the County of Halifax on both sides of the Nine Mile river situate to th1 CONC e north of Archibald's Mill and . . . containing four acres more or less . . . " The lease cost Hughes $12,500 with rep1 CONC ayments to be made at $40.00 per week plus interest until the full amount had been repaid. A fire on 20 August 1875 des1 CONC troyed the mill and its contents. It was never rebuilt.”1 CONT1 CONT In 1840, Thomas appears to be letting go of the Bedford property, as evident from this newspaper article of March 11, 11 CONC 840. “Valuable Property. The Subscriber offers for sale, near the Nine-Mile River Bridge – A Water Lot, on Bedford Basi1 CONC n, fronting on the Windsor Road 150 feet, and running 200 feet into the Basin; there are on the premises a new Store 31 CONC 0 feet square, 2 stories high, and a wharf attached to it; the store can be made into a good dwelling house at a smal1 CONC l expense.

Jeffery leased to Thomas Goff, farmer, Windsor Rd., the dwelling, farm, saw mill, mill pond and lan1 CONC d situated on the Windsor Road known as the 30 mile house, provided that he would not use the premises as a tavern or p1 CONC ublic house, an arrangement which continued for at least two years. We have a copy of that lease, found in the home o1 CONC f Mr. Alex Goff. Thomas and Eleanor’s 9th child was born in 1841.1 CONT1 CONT (Note: Thomas Nickleson Jeffrey (1783-21 Oct 1847 Halifax), Collector of Customs in Halifax, s/o John Jeffrey of Poole1 CONC , Dorset, England, m 3 May 1805 Martha Maria Uniacke (16 Oct 1785-15 Nov 1873) d/o Attorney General Richard J.

The Windsor Road followed th1 CONC e Old Sackville Road and Route 1 of today. Uniacke House is at Mile 27.

His son William’s first grant was in 1846. Thomas and E1 CONC leanor’s 10th and last child (Catherine Elizabeth Pirie) was born at Guysborough Road (St. Johns Church baptism record1 CONC ) in 1846 (the Pirie family bible recorded her birthplace as Antrim, Halifax Co, as copied by Connie Hill).1 CONT1 CONT Two receipts in the possession of Douglas Goff (originally obtained from the Thomson family) read as follows: “Jan. 31 CONC , 1842, I agree to pay Nicolas Holland the sum of two pounds for the hire of two cows for one year Halifax currency an1 CONC d to return them in the same order as they are at present likewise the sum of twenty four shillings Halifax currency fo1 CONC r the hire of eight sheep for one year and to return them in the same order as they are at present.

Received payment Thomas Goff (X his mark) witness William Goff”. I suspect “Musquodoboit” referred to Thoma1 CONC s’ home on the Guysborough Road.1 CONT1 CONT The New Guysborough Rd branched from the Truro Rd. at present day Waverley- the original Truro Rd (Old Cobequid Road) s1 CONC tayed east of Lake Thomas to present-day Fall River, then west of Fletcher’s Lake along Hwy 2, whereas the Guysboroug1 CONC h Rd went west of Fletcher’s Lake and east of Miller Lake, probably Hwy 2 and then current 102, until it joined what w1 CONC e know as the Old Guys Rd today (Dawson).

They ran a Stage Coach Inn which was no doubt a welcome sight to travellers when they finished the firs1 CONC t part of their journey. The early days of stage coaches in Nova Scotia were described by R.D. Evans in a paper read be1 CONC fore the Nova Scotia Historical Society on March 20, 1936 (Collections, NSHS, 1938, Vol. 24). He reports that the semi-1 CONC weekly Guysborough stage was established in 1861 by a man named Archibald and ran from Halifax to Musquobodoit, Guysbor1 CONC ough, St. Mary's, Country Harbour, and Port Mulgrave. The coach set out from Dartmouth, through North Preston, and then1 CONC ce pursued a northerly course through the woods to emerge on the Guysboro Road at the Inn familiarly known as "Goff’s"1 CONC , a name which became adopted for the local village and has carried on to the present time. 1 CONT1 CONT Archibald secured the mail route in 1862 along the Guysborough Road and including the Eastern Shore and Tangiers, and b1 CONC y 1879, the Goff's Inn had also become the area's post office which carried on at the same house until 1969. The hous1 CONC e later became the home of James Ledwidge but has been left only in memory and pictures. Stories about the old propert1 CONC y have appeared at least twice in Halifax newspapers. It was directly opposite to the Goff's school, which was for a pe1 CONC riod of time used as the community fire hall. A new fire hall and recreation centre has been built on the site of the G1 CONC off's school, directly opposite the site of the Goff's home.

They have a son buried in Kempt, 1860, a1 CONC nd the obituaries of two other children (Alexander and Martha) said they were born in Kempt, but removed when small chi1 CONC ldren with their parents to Devon, Halifax County.

Rachel’s mother died in 11 CONC 865 in Antrim, so this is perhaps when they moved back. They settled  near the original home of Archibald McMullen, Rac1 CONC hel’s grandfather. Daniel was said to have been a sea-going person (rigger in the 1871 census in Devon, Halifax Co.), a1 CONC nd in later years as a farmer (as listed in the 1881 census) was extremely good at climbing and in rope knot-tying (sto1 CONC ries as remembered by the family). 1 CONT1 CONT Their marriage record in the PRESBYTERIAN WITNESS Sat 3 Mar 1855, No. 9, p. 35, is as follows: "Married: Donald McDouga1 CONC l on 15th ult., to Rachel McMullin, by Rev.

If one looks at the birth of their children, the first was born i1 CONC n 1848 (Willie, a young son buried in Kempt), but then the rest of the pattern goes 1856, 1858, 1860, 1862, 1865, 18671 CONC , and 1869. In 1848, Daniel and Rachel were 17 and 16 respectively.

Gough in celtic had meant "red", which perhaps described the reddened colour of the face o1 CONC f a blacksmith working before his forge. Welshmen historically moved to England, Scotland, and Ireland following the es1 CONC tablishment of English control over Wales, and there is much evidence that the Gough family fit this pattern as well, w1 CONC ith Gough/Goff members showing up in all of the countries of the British Isles. Most used the traditional Welsh spellin1 CONC g of "Gough"; however, many Goffe's and Goff's were appearing by the mid sixteenth century. The were many more Goff’s i1 CONC n the 1700’s in England than Ireland. Most of the Irish Goff’s were originally of English, and thus probably originall1 CONC y of Welsh, descent. There was also a considerable migration of Goff’s from England to the United States throughout th1 CONC e late 1600’s and 1700’s, and the name Goff is far more widespread now in the US than anywhere else. There is a very ac1 CONC tive Goff Family Association in the US. The Who's Who Master Index for 1985, a compilation of the Who's Who volumes o1 CONC f notable people representing all aspects of life and society in the world of the past and present, lists 125 Goff name1 CONC s, of whom 10 are named as Goffe, and 95 Gough names. These people include former English Statesmen, American revolutio1 CONC nary soldiers, U.S. Senators, athletes, and prominent women in society. Mr. Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister of th1 CONC e Australian Parliament in the 1970's.1 CONT1 CONT In the Republic of Ireland, the name Goff was found in most abundance in Co. Wexford whereas the name Gough was primari1 CONC ly found in Co. Waterford; both of these counties are in the southeast. The Tithe Applotment books of 1824-34, record1 CONC s of land holders who owed tithes to the Church of Ireland, record the Goff name in a total of 36 parishes across 15 o1 CONC f the 32 counties of Ireland - 14 parishes in Co. Wexford, 4 in Co. Waterford, and in 1 or 2 parishes in several othe1 CONC r counties. The Gough name is recorded in 60 parishes in 21 of 32 counties across the country - 11 in Waterford and 1 i1 CONC n Wexford. Wexford Co. currently has the highest number of “Goff’s” in Ireland. There were at least two prominent Gough1 CONC /Goff families in Wexford Co.  The Ballyorley House in Boolavogue, Ferns, County Wexford, was the original property o1 CONC f Clement Gough, built in 1675. Clement was a descendant of Garrett Gough, who settled in Ireland in 1530. The Ballyorl1 CONC ey property in 1998 was in the ownership of Mrs. Micheal Gough and her daughter. I (Doug Goff) visited and had a wonder1 CONC ful tour of the property, which hasn’t left Gough hands since it was built. The house was wonderfully decorated with po1 CONC rtraits of its many inhabitants. John Gough (now deceased) of Clifton Royal on the Saint John River, N.B.,  establishe1 CONC d a link between Gough’s of this family and a Gough/Goff family that ended up in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick1 CONC , from whom he descended. 1 CONT1 CONT Another prominent Goff family originated from Horetown House, in Horetown, Co. Wexford. It was built by Richard Goffe1 CONC , son of Gen. William Goffe, who was the son of Rev. Stephen Goffe of Sussex County, England. Major-Gen. William Goff1 CONC e rose to prominence in the days of Oliver Cromwell. He was one of the regicide judges of King Charles I. However, afte1 CONC r the death of Cromwell and the restoration of King Charles II to the British throne, the new government offered reward1 CONC s for the capture, dead or alive, of the regicide judges. Col. William Goffe fled to the colonies with his father-in-la1 CONC w Joseph Whalley and was befriended by sympathetic partisans of Cromwell and Parliament in Hadley, Massachusetts, wher1 CONC e he died in seclusion in 1679. This family of Goff’s in Ireland were part of the Anglo-Irish protestants, and a recen1 CONC t memoire has been written by Annabel Davis-Goff, entitled “Walled Gardens”. There is also a very good account writte1 CONC n by Dinah Goff from this family of the 1798 rebellion in Wexford. Horetown House is now used for overnight guests, hor1 CONC se trekking, etc. I (Doug Goff) visited also in 1998, and was most impressed with its stature. A genealogy of the Gof1 CONC f family was prominently displayed on the fireplace mantle. One of the descendents of this family from Horetown, Fade G1 CONC off, also ended up in Prince Edward Island, in a position of some authority. He has been written up in the Canadian Dic1 CONC tionary of Biography. There is  a local community named Goff's Bridge in PEI. 1 CONT1 CONT Beside these two families from Wexford, there were a few other scattered “Goff” families. There were Irish Catholic “O’1 CONC Goffe” and MacGeough, derived not from the Welsh Gough but from the Celtic. There were also Goff families in Ulster Ire1 CONC land, undoubtedly English immigrants. The modern Goff family in the Republic of Ireland is well known for their horsema1 CONC nship abilities, and I (Doug Goff) also visited Goff’s Paddocks and Auction in County Kildare, not far from Dublin, on1 CONC e of the best horse breeding and trading stables in the British Isles.1 CONT1 CONT The earliest known ancestor of ours in Nova Scotia was John Goff, who it appears married a widow with 6 children in 1791 CONC 6 in Cornwallis, Kings Co. (at least the marriage is recorded at St. John’s Church, Cornwallis). We are unsure of the o1 CONC rigins of John, although family tradition certainly held that he was of Irish descent and both his daughter Mary and hi1 CONC s son Thomas declared their nationality in NS census records as Irish, as did his grandson William. Whether he came dir1 CONC ect from Ireland to NS or via the US is not known by us. Is our John descended from any of the families in Co. Wexfor1 CONC d Ireland? I don’t know.  One of the grandchildren of Thomas Anthony Gough, grandson of the original John, understood t1 CONC he family to be from County Waterford,  perhaps from family folklore, which is very intriguing as it borders Co. Wexfor1 CONC d and may imply a connection to one of those families. Certainly the surname Gough was more widespread in Waterford a1 CONC t that time. If he came from the US, it is much more likely that he was English rather than Irish, due to the numbers o1 CONC f English Goffs in the US. I have records of, and have corresponded with many researchers of, many of the early America1 CONC n Goff families, but never found a John of the right age to migrate to NS. It is also unknown whether he came alone o1 CONC r with family. Many of the colonizers to NS were from America or from England or Ireland (mostly the Scots-Irish). Gene1 CONC rally, they immigrated with large families, aged parents with several grown children and their wives and children. Thes1 CONC e families have been well documented by the early histories of the various counties of Nova Scotia. We have no such kno1 CONC wledge of our John, however, who appears to have been on his own, or perhaps with unmarried siblings that left little o1 CONC r no progeny. Thus, the origins of John are difficult to find and may never be fully known.1 CONT1 CONT A John Goff received a town lot in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, in 1784, but we are unsure if this is the same John.  It see1 CONC ms perhaps unlikely that John would have started off in Shelburne, 10 years later married someone in Cornwallis in 17961 CONC , and then found himself with his family in Bedford in 1812. A Thomas Goff received 100 acres in Digby Township in th1 CONC e same year. Also there is a marriage record of James Goff to Elizabeth Crawford in Halifax in 1777. This same James (“1 CONC soldier”) appears to have tangled with the law over the shooting of one Christopher Schlegall, 1 Nov. 1776 (Proceeding1 CONC s of the Nova Scotia Historical Society), although there was no conviction.1 CONT1 CONT Ann (McCormack) Goff had 6 children from her McCormack marriage, and John and Ann had a further 3 children. This come1 CONC s from a page of a family bible, from the home of Edna (Goff) Warner. Their son Thomas stated his birthplace as Halifax1 CONC , 1796. Her maiden name and origin are unknown. The Goff children included Thomas (who md. Eleanor Holland), Mary (wh1 CONC o md. Nicholas Holland, a brother of Anthony Holland and Eleanor Holland, Thomas’ wife) and William, who died young. Th1 CONC us Thomas became the progenitor of our family.1 CONT1 CONT John Goff of Dartmouth, Yeoman, received a land grant of 230 acres at Bedford Basin, April 1, 1813 (Crown Land Grants F1 CONC olio 11, Book C, page 100), comprised of a block of 100 acres granted in 1810 and another 130 acres between the origina1 CONC l block and the eastern shore of Bedford Basin. From Land Grant maps of the Nova Scotia Crown Land Information Manageme1 CONC nt Centre, Halifax, John’s 230 acres stretched from Roach Cove east to Anderson Lake (along today’s Bedford Bypass (Hw1 CONC y 7) and at the site of the Department of National Defence Magazine depot ‘Magazine Hill’).  The birthplace of John’s s1 CONC on Thomas in 1796 was Halifax, on Thomas’ death certificate. If John and Ann married in Cornwallis, they didn’t stay th1 CONC ere long, as Thomas was born 6 months after the wedding. It appears likely they were in the greater Halifax/Darthmout1 CONC h area somewhere, and by 1810 were on the east side of the Bedford Basin, between Dartmouth and Bedford.1 CONT1 CONT Land was granted to Richard Cunningham on the east side of Bedford Basin, formerly granted to Mrs. Mary Magdalen Howe1 CONC , on 17 Oct. 1816, adjacent to the land granted to John Goff at the head of Lobster Cove, and continuing to Pace’s Broo1 CONC k.  Mrs. Howe owned all the land south of Parker’s Brook (today’s name) as far as Roche’s Cove, including Admiral’s Cov1 CONC e (Tolson). Darius Pace came to Bedford in the late 1700’s. Between the Sackville River and Parker’s Brook was the lan1 CONC d owned by Joseph Scott; from the Brook south to Roche’s Cove was Mary Howe’s 560 acres. She leased her land to Pace af1 CONC ter 1772. An old plan in the Crown Lands Office shows Pace’s Brook and Pace’s Cove. It was he who named Admiral’s Rock1 CONC , after Admiral Lord Nelson. At that time, the east side was the less-developed side. In the early 19th century, Dartmo1 CONC uth consisted of about twenty-five families working as a sawmill and agricultural outpost of Halifax. By 1823, there wa1 CONC s a “new Dartmouth Road to Sackville”, but it did not receive the traffic of the Halifax Road to Bedford. The route t1 CONC o Halifax from the east side would have been overland via the Bedford Road or perhaps to Dartmouth and via boat acros1 CONC s the harbour. 1 CONT1 CONT There is reference to John having received another 500 acres at Bedford Basin in 1819 recorded from the Land Grant Inde1 CONC x at the Provincial Archives of Nova Scotia, but no record of this can be found from the Crown Lands Grant maps or in t1 CONC he Crown Land Information Management Centre.1 CONT1 CONT John Goff of Bedford Basin, Husbandman, also received a Land Grant of 500 acres split on both sides of the Annapolis Ro1 CONC ad out of Hammonds Plains, 28 April 1824, bordering the lands of Frederick Rhalves (Crown Land Grants Folio 207, Book L1 CONC , page 2). (From Joan Dawson’s book, the original Hammonds Plains Road leaving the Bedford Road was headed towards Anna1 CONC polis via New Ross). This can be seen on the old Land Grant maps, and includes the current areas south of Kelly’s Lak1 CONC e and Long Lake, between Chain Lakes and Holloway Lake (then Rhalves Lake), south and including Hubley Mill Lake, and t1 CONC hen east to Pogwa Lake in the area west of Hammonds Plains and north of the Head of St. Margarets Bay. This today is un1 CONC developed land: rock, lakes and bogs.

As a very young man, however, he displeas1 CONC ed his father by leaving a gate open and letting some cattle go free. His father had a bad temper and was a hard discip1 CONC linarian, so George packed his things, kissed his mother goodby and left for the USA. He worked there for several years1 CONC , mostly on farms. It was there that he met and courted his future wife, Fanny Fraser, also from Nova Scotia, who was w1 CONC orking there also.  When they decided to be married, they came back to be married in Fanny's church in West Gore. The f1 CONC irst winter, they spent with George's parents in Clementsvale.

He built a new house on the property, when he came back, and he cleared the land. The barn - one of th1 CONC e tallest around - he built when his youngest son was about four years old. He also worked for many years in a grocer1 CONC y store, first in Oldham, then in Elmsdale, owned by Evan Thompson. He was a valued employee, as he had a very keen mem1 CONC ory, and was quick at arithmetic. As his family grew he often travelled on the train to Halifax, where he worked on man1 CONC y of the buildings there, including the Nova Scotian Hotel and St. Matthews Church, as a building foreman. At one time1 CONC , he was given the job of building highway bridges, in the county. He was made Justice of the Peace, and his law book1 CONC s and legal documents were still in his desk, when a fire destroyed the home, many years after his death. He was stil1 CONC l a fairly young man, when after working too long in the rain, he took a serious inflammation, and infection of the pro1 CONC strate gland. He was operated on, but the poison had spread and he died. He had worked hard all his life to support hi1 CONC s family in an affluent style. He was interested in politics, and worked diligently for his party, had a strong communi1 CONC ty spirit and was much involved with the church and other community affairs, a highly respected man. As a young man, i1 CONC n his home area, he was known as Port Wright, rather than George, from his second name Davenport. He was always a fearl1 CONC ess man, ready to tackle anything. As a boy, one night he had been visiting his uncle, and as the evening wore on, th1 CONC e grown ups had been telling ghost stories. It was late and dark, when little Port started for home, thinking about th1 CONC e tales he had been told. Suddenly in the dark field, he spied something large and white and he immediately decided i1 CONC t must be one of those ghosts. Instead of doing the usual thing - running for his life - Port decided to attack the gho1 CONC st! He made for the white shape and was going to hit it with a stick, when the ghostly appearing shape leaped to its fe1 CONC et and ran away -- an old white horse! In later years his home was known as a place where a hungry traveller could fin1 CONC d a meal or a bed for the night.
